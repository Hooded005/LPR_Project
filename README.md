For the project, create a program that solves Linear Programming and Integer Programming Models 
and then analyses how the changes in an LPâ€™s parameters change the optimal solution.
Supply the source code as a visual studio project. Any .NET programming language may be used. The 
project should build an executable (solve.exe) that is menu driven with the following:
The program should be able to accept an input text file with the mathematical model and export all 
results to an output text file.
